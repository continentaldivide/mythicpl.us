Sincere thank yous to everyone who joined.</p><h3 id=why-shut-down-the-patreon>Why shut down the Patreon?<a href=#why-shut-down-the-patreon class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h3><p>I moved mythicpl.us off my DigitalOcean VPS and to Netlify to make the update pipeline simpler.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t need to pay for hosting anymore as a result.</p><p>The donations I have gathered so far are enough to renew the mythicpl.us domain name for 7+ years. I&rsquo;ll continue to renew it for as long as World of Warcraft is a relevant game.<br>I&rsquo;ll continue to renew it for awhile after World of Warcraft has lost its relevancy to prevent malware/squatters.</p><p>I will be winding down the Patreon by the end of this month to avoid charges to folks for January. Thank you to everyone who donated during this time. Your support allowed mythicpl.us to stay up and ad, tracker, and surveillance free. (Note: it&rsquo;s still all these things today)</p><p>Special thanks to those who have been giving since the beginning. Anyone who has given will be enshrined in a separate web page. Thank you again for sticking with me and my shitty writing for so long.</p><h3 id=wrapping-up-and-a-little-trivia>Wrapping up (and a little trivia)<a href=#wrapping-up-and-a-little-trivia class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h3><p>mythicpl.us really started as me trying to dispel misinformation and centralize information about the newly added keystone system way back in Legion. It was a single, monolithic web page that I typed up on my breaks at work. I wanted it to be lightweight and easy to read, especially for new players.</p><p>Part of the whole experiment was seeing if I could host the site on my own, secure it, and iterate on it. It&rsquo;s been around 5 years since I started hosting this site. It wouldn&rsquo;t have been possible without all the great contributers on Github and patrons. Thank you all again.</p><p>As always, you can contact me via Discord (domaiN#3732) or email (admin @ this website). Pull requests are always welcome on GitHub to maintain accuracy of the site.</p><img src=/news/icon.png alt="m+ logo" class=center></div></div><div class=pagination><div class=pagination__title><span class=pagination__title-h>Read other posts</span><hr></div><div class=pagination__buttons><span class="button previous"><a href=https://mythicpl.us/news/posts/changelog/><span class=button__icon>←</span>
