The site design annoyed me and information about mythic plus was fragmented across a hundred different blog-style posts. I set out to make a site that was:</p><ul><li><p>easy to read and comprehend. You should be able to show your friend who has never done mythic plus before this site as a primer.</p></li><li><p>fast and clean. No third party trackers or ads. No heavy Javascript, no autoplaying videos, no scrolljacking, etc</p></li><li><p>privacy respecting (uBlock Origin should show 0 blocked for this site ðŸ˜Š)</p></li><li><p>a showcase of community made stuff, and a curated list of addons and Weakauras. This mostly started with addons and Weakauras that I used personally, but grew into promoting raider.io early on, and steering people to community Discord servers.</p></li><li><p>easy to contribute to. My interest in World of Warcraft waxes and wanes, but I want to keep the information up-to-date and useful even if I&rsquo;m not playing the game. Every commit is on <a href=https://github.com/domainzero/mythicpl.us>Github</a> (for better or for worse - I am an absolute idiot and commit really dumb things), and pull requests are always welcome.</p></li></ul><p>Selfishly, this whole project has also been a way to teach me stuff. I learned a good amount about processing JSON, utilizing APIs, optimizing web servers, CI/CD, etc from all this. I&rsquo;ve been changing and iterating the backend for this site since it was created. This was a static site that I had to update every week. I have since automated many of those tasks.</p><p>Thanks again for visiting!
