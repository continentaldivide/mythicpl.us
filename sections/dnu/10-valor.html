				<p>Flightstones and crests are the currency you'll use to upgrade your gear. They come from pretty much any endgame activity, and harder content awards better crests.</p>
				<p>With the changes to Mythic+ that came with Season 4, crest acquisition has changed a little.</p>
				<p>You can no longer get <span class="easy">Whelpling Crests</span> from Mythic+, you must obtain them from heroic dungeons or world content.</p>
				<p><span class="med">Wyrm Crests</span> will drop at the end of +2 through +5 runs.</p>
				<p><span class="hard">Aspect crests</span> will drop at the end of +6 and higher runs.</p>
