			<h1 class="title title--large">Group Considerations</h1>
			<div class="text-block">
				<p><strong>Group makeup barely matters at low keystone levels. There is little reason to sweat your group composition on keys below 15. Bring the player, not the class.</strong></p>
				<p>That being said, your group composition will always be one tank, one healer, and three DPS. Multi-tank strategies are not viable, no matter how much you think they should be.</p>
				<p>It's important to build a group that is well rounded in order increase your chances of completing a keystone within the timer. This means bringing consumables to make up for gaps in your group composition.</p>
				<p>When considering your group composition, it is important to consider what each class can bring to the table. Does your group have:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>ways to dispel buffs on enemies?</li>
					<li>ways to dispel debuffs on allies?</li>
					<li>multiple interrupts or other CC to stop enemy casting?</li>
					<li>strong CC for difficult trash pulls?</li>
				</ol>
				<p>Selecting your group carefully matters mostly for higher level keys where the difficulty of the run is often very high. For lower level keystone runs, group makeup is not as important. Just saying. Do what you want. <pre><code>¯\_(ツ)_/¯</code></pre></p>
				<h2 class="title">Consumables</h2>
				<h3 class="title">Mandatory (at least above keystone level 5)</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>Current food</li>
					<li>Current phials</li>
					<li>Current potions</li>
					<li>Repair mount/Auto-Hammer/Jeeves/Reeves</li>
				</ol>
				<h3 class="title">"Missing a class" consumables</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>Drums (any tier is fine, they all give 15% haste <sup><a href="https://www.icy-veins.com/forums/topic/51841-drums-haste-effects-nerfed-to-15-in-shadowlands/">[source]</a></sup>): sorta makes up for no Bloodlust/Heroism/Time Warp/Hysteria, but the nerf from 25% haste to 15% really hurts the value of drums.</li>
				</ol>
				<h3 class="title">Optional/niche/high key consumables</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>Invisibility potions (used for skipping troubling trash packs at high key levels)</li>
					<li>Augment runes</li>
				</ol>

			<h2 class="title title--large">"No one will invite me to a group!"</h2>
			<div class="text-block">
				<p>It sucks to apply to 50 groups and get declined from every single one.</p>
				<p>Most of the time when you apply to a key, 100 other people apply to the same key and your application gets buried.</p><br>

				<p>Unfortunately, lots of people want to do keys and people running groups have the luxury of choosing people that may be better geared than you or have a higher Mythic+ rating than you.</p>
				<p>There are a few ways to ensure you can get into keys:</p>
				<ol>
					<li><strong>Start your own group with your own key</strong>. This gives YOU the luxury of forming the group and is the only guaranteed way to get into a key.</li>
					<li>Look for groups with "chill run" in the title</li>
					<li>Play a tank or healer (or force a friend to)</li>
					<li><a href="#discords">Join a group finding Discord</a></li>
					<li>Join a guild that is active and Mythic+ focused</li>
					<li>Shoot your shot. Apply to a bunch of keys, even keys that you think may be one or two levels too hard for you</li>
				</ol>
				<p>Grinding out score can be frustrating when it takes 45 minutes to find a group, especially when it's a key you need and the group disbands after one mistake. All you can do is try your best. I got declined from over 600+ Mythic+ group applications throughout Shadowlands. I promise not everyone out there is an elitist that's out to get you.</p>
