				<p>Complete a keystone run within the timer to upgrade a keystone to the next level.</p>
				<p>Complete a keystone run with 20% of the timer remaining and upgrade the keystone 2 times in one go.</p>
				<p>Complete a keysone run with 40% of the timer remaining and upgrade the keystone 3 times in one go.</p>
				<p>Didn't beat the timer? That's ok. Your keystone just levels down by 1 and rerolls the dungeon.</br><span class="affixes-list__note">Example: Your group completes Waycrest Manor +5 but misses the timer. Your keystone downgrades to a random dungeon at +4.</span></p>
				<p>Don't have a keystone? Completing a Mythic difficulty dungeon will net you a key at the end of the run. This keystone will be one level under the keystone run level you complete, or +2 if you completed a Mythic +0.<br><br>There's also a vendor named Lindormi in Valdrakken that will give you a key based on your highest run completed, no dungeon run required.<sup><a href="#example1">1</a></sup>
				<br>
				<br>
				You can also get a key from the Great Vault based on the highest key you completed last week. If you did a 15 last week, you'll get a 15 this week from your vault.<br>
				If you do not complete any keystones for a week, the level degrades by 1 and continues to degrade by one for every week you do not do a higher difficulty keystone.<sup><a href="#example2">2</a></sup>
				<br>

				<span id="example1" class="affixes-list__note"><sup>[1]</sup> Example: you complete an Atal'dazar  +7 - the chest at the end will have a random +6 key in it.</span><br><br>
				<span id="example2" class="affixes-list__note"><sup>[2]</sup> Example: Your highest key you complete for a week is a 15, but you do not do a key the following week. Your keystone degrades to a +14 on the third week.</span></p>

			<h2 class="title">Time penalty for deaths</h2>
			<div class="text-block">
				<p>Five seconds are subtracted from the timer any time a player dies in a keystone run. While this may seem inconsequential at first, the time lost to death will add up quickly if players die to mechanics frequently. This can easily result in missing the timer.</p>

			<div class="text-block">
				<p>The following table shows the amount of time you have to complete a keystone run and upgrade your key. The +2 and +3 columns show how much time you have to complete a keystone run in order to +2 or +3 a key.</p>
