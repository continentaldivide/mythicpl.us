			<h1 class="title title--large">Useful stuff</h1>
			<div class="text-block">
				<h2 class="title title--medium title--left">Addons</h2>
				<p>This is not a definitive list of <em>THINGS YOU NEED</em>, but a list of addons/WeakAuras that I like and find useful. </p>
				<br>
				<h3 class="title title--small title--left">Addon Managers</h3>
				<h3 class="title title--small title--left">A brief message about addon managers</h3>
				<p>As someone who values their privacy online, I feel like it's important that I mention the Overwolf client is BAD and all of its privacy options are OPT-OUT by default, instead of OPT-IN. I encourage you to use an open source addon manager like <a href="https://wowup.io">wowup.io</a> or <a href="https://github.com/layday/instawow">instawow</a>. Just my two cents.</p>
				<h3 class="title title--small title--left">Timers</h3>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/warpdeplete">WarpDeplete</a> - Nice timer. It's probably the one you see streamers use.</li>
					<li><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/angry-keystones">Angry Keystones</a> - Another take on the keystone/mythic+ timer. Displays affix rotation schedule and current affixes as well as providing chest timers and kill count % ingame.</li>
					<li><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/ip-mythic-timer">iP Mythic Timer</a> - A combo timer with a great deal of customization. Shows timer for +2 and +3, % per mob, total percent pulled, and more!</li>
				</ul>
				<h3 class="title title--small title--left">Dungeon information/boss mods</h3>
				<ul>

					<li><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/little-wigs">LittleWigs</a> - Requires <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/big-wigs">BigWigs Boss Mods.</a> A lightweight boss mod suite tailored for dungeons.</li>
				</ul>
				<h3 class="title title--small title--left">Keystone and group information</h3>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/mythic-dungeon-tools">Mythic Dungeon Tools</a> - Plan out routes, then use a shareable interactive map to make sure your group is on the same page.</li>
					<li><a href="https://raider.io/addon">Raider.io Addon</a> - Hover over players in the world, guild, etc and get their raider.io score. The addon comes with an updater client to automatically get people's scores from raider.io!</li>
					<li><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/astral-keys">Astral Keys</a> - Shows keys for guild mates, Battle Net friends and alts.</li>
				</ul>
				<h2 class="title title--medium title--left">Weakauras</h2>
				<br>
				<h3 class="title title--small title--left">Mechanical WeakAuras</h3>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="https://wago.io/MInterruptTracker">M+ Interrupt Tracker</a> - Lists and tracks your group's interrupts.</li>
					<li><a href="https://wago.io/tcIVwLsy9">The War Within Dungeons</a> - Comprehensive alerts for trash and boss abilities. Covers things bossmods do not. Optionally offers simple verbal queues such as "stack, spread, dance, etc." <strong>Absolutely invaluable.</strong></li>
				</ul>
				<h3 class="title title--small title--left">General Information & Utility WeakAuras</h3>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="https://wago.io/M+Timer">M+ Timer (WeakAura)</a> - Mythic plus timer with a lot of bonus features, including auto-gossip/interact, MDT integration, and more!</li>
					<li><a href="https://wago.io/RaidAbilityTimeline">Raid Ability Timeline</a> - Creates a bar that shows upcoming boss abilities visually. Requires Deadly Boss Mods or BigWigs.</li>
					<li><a href="https://wago.io/6-GG3RMcC">Dungeon RIO and Classes</a> - Requires <a href="https://raider.io/addon">raider.io addon</a>. Shows LFG group leader's raider.io score in group title, class icons under roles, and applicant raider.io score before their names.</li>

				<h2 class="title title--medium title--left">Stats, tools, and guides</h2>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="https://raider.io/mythic-plus/all/world/leaderboards">raider.io</a> - Raider.io has all kinds of tools including character specific M+ tracking, successful run comp tracking, and ranks for m+ dungeons. Their <a href="https://raider.io/addon">addon</a> is probably the most useful group building/vetting addon you'll find as it uses their scoring system to show you how experienced players are.</li>
