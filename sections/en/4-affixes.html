					<li class="affixes-list__item-10 affix-fortified">
						<p><span class="hard">Fortified</span></p>
						<p>Non-bosses have more health and deal 30% more damage.</p>
						<p class="affixes-list__note">Note: interrupting and dodging any/all enemy abilities becomes an absolute priority with this affix. Most of the time spent in the dungeon will be fighting beefy trash.</p>

						<p>Bosses have 30% more health and deal 15% more damage.</p>
						<p class="affixes-list__note">Note: Boss abilities are no longer trivial. Boss mechanics need to be respected (don't stand in stuff!). Some fights become endurance tests because they last so long.</p>

				<ul class="affixes-list">
					<li class="affixes-list__item-4-7 affix-afflicted">
						<p><span class="med">Afflicted</span></p>
						<p>While in combat, <b>Afflicted Souls</b> periodically appear and seek the aid of players. They must be <b>healed to full</b> or <b>dispelled</b> before their cast, Afflicted Cry, goes off or they will reduce all players haste by 100% for 10 seconds.</p>
						<p class="affixes-list__note">Note: any dispel works. Afflicted Cry can be line-of-sighted, and has a 60 yard range.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="affixes-list__item-4-7 affix-incorporeal">
						<p><span class="hard">Incorporeal</span></p>
						<p>Incorporeal beings periodically spawn and cast <b>Destabilize</b>. If the cast goes off, player damage and healing is reduced by 50%. The debuff stacks. The mobs do not take damage and can only be crowd controlled.</p>
						<p class="affixes-list__note">Note: Long CC is really nice during this week. Any CC works, including banish or shackle undead.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="affixes-list__item-4-7 affix-volcanic">
						<p><span class="easy">Volcanic</span></p>
						<p>Enemies cause eruptions of flame near distant players. Additional volcanoes may appear near existing volcanoes.</p>
						<p class="affixes-list__note">Note: Keep an eye out for the volcano animation under your feet or near you. Sometimes you may not have to move! Knocks you high in to the air in addition to doing damage scaled to the keystone level.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="affixes-list__item-4-7 affix-entangling">
						<p><span class="easy">Entangling</span></p>
						<p>Entangling vines periodically appear and slow players. Moving away from the vines will snap the vine and remove the debuff. If players do not move from the vine before the debuff expires, players are stunned for 3 seconds.</p>
						<p class="affixes-list__note">Note: movement immunities like Freedom, Posthaste, etc will remove the debuff.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="affixes-list__item-4-7 affix-storming">
						<p><span class="med">Storming</span></p>
						<p>Tornadoes spawn around enemy creatures while in combat.</p>
						<p class="affixes-list__note" data-trn-key="storming_note">Note: Grey swirlies appear on the floor indicating where a tornado will spawn. If a player is hit by the tornado, they take damage and are knocked back. The tornado disappears a player comes in contact with it.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div class="affixes-block">
				<h3 class="title title--medium affixes-block__title">Level 14 affixes<br>

				</h3>
				<ul class="affixes-list">
					<li class="affixes-list__item-4-7 affix-spiteful">
						<p><span class="med">Spiteful</span></p>
						<p>Spirits rise from the corpses of non-boss enemies and chase down random players, dealing <b>HEAVY</b> melee damage.</p>
						<p class="affixes-list__note">Note: Whenever an enemy dies, it spawns a <i>Spiteful Shade</i> that will fixate on a random player. Their health and damage scales with keystone level. They lose 8% of their HP every second and can be crowd controlled.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="affixes-list__item-4-7 affix-raging">
						<p><span class="med">Raging</span></p>
						<p>Non-boss enemies enrage at 30% health, becoming immune to crowd control other than interrupts.</p>
						<p class="affixes-list__note">Note: enemies with high damage targeted abilities or high damage AoE abilities become deadly with this affix. Be sure to focus fire enemies down so there aren't multiple enraged enemies at once. Soothe effects remove the enrage!</p>
					</li>
					<li class="affixes-list__item-4-7 affix-bolstering">
						<p><span class="med">Bolstering</span></p>
						<p>Non-boss enemies buff nearby allies on death, increasing damage by 20%. This effect stacks.</p>
						<p class="affixes-list__note">Note: it's important to kill all the trash in a pull as closely together as possible with this affix so enemy damage doesn't become unmanageable. Enemies spawned by another enemy or boss ability do not trigger bolster. Bolstering stacks fall off 20 seconds after they were applied.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="affixes-list__item-4-7 affix-bursting">
						<p><span class="med">Bursting</span></p>
						<p>Non-boss enemies explode on death, causing all players to suffer flat damage that scales with keystone level. This effect stacks.</p>
						<p class="affixes-list__note">Note: This effect stacks, so it is safest to let the stacks drop before killing multiple enemies. Typically only <strong>elite</strong> enemies trigger bursting. Now dispellable!</p>
					</li>
					<li class="affixes-list__item-4-7 affix-sanguine">
						<p><span class="easy">Sanguine</span></p>
						<p>Non-boss enemies will leave a pool of blood on the ground on death. This pool heals enemies and damages players for a percentage of their maximum health.</p>
						<p class="affixes-list__note">Note: The pool's radius is 8 yds. Pools last 12 seconds.</p>

			<h4 class="title title--small trn">Weekly schedule for affixes</h4>
			<div class="text-block">
				<p>The following table shows the affix schedule for the entirety of the current season. </p>
				<p><span class="affixes-list__note">How are you getting this information?</span><br>Affix combination difficulty is sourced from <a href="https://mplus.subcreation.net/all-affixes.html">subcreation.</a><br> Affix schedule is recorded as the combinations occur until a repeat is seen, then the schedule is known. It's been that way since the creation of mythic plus back in Legion. Difficulty should be taken with a grain of salt as the <span class="hard">difficulty is based on most successful keys from +17 to +30</span>, not accounting for the natural curve of gear, tier, etc.<br><br>
				<span class="affixes-list__note">Isn't that kind of tiering biased toward the top end of players?</span><br>
				Yes, and it's worth noting that we're still only in the first rotation of the affixes as of 03 January, so expect these difficulties to shift as the season progresses.
				<br><br>
				<span class="affixes-list__note">What makes an affix combination easier than others?</span><br>
				Affix combination difficulty is based on number of successful runs and key levels completed during the affix combination week. Failed runs are not taken into account. More information can be found on the <a href="https://subcreation.net/faq.html">subcreation FAQ.</a>
				<br><br>
				<span class="affixes-list__note">What is the scale you're using for difficulty?</span><br>
				Subcreation sorts these affix combinations on a tier list from S to F, with S being very easy and F being very hard. Instead of just using the tier listing, I have added some language to convey the difficulty with <span class="easy">"free"</span> being the easiest (the affixes don't actively get in the way of your run/don't hurt your chances of success) and <span class="hard">"pain"</span> being the hardest (the affixes make the run much more difficult/more likely to fail).
