			<div class="text-block">
			<p>Rather than inundate you with a ton of information, I'm going to give you a brief rundown of the system and then link you to more in-depth sheets/documents.</p>
			<p>
				I hate this system, haha! It's complicated! It has shit scattered everywhere! It takes up space in your bags! It requires you to keep so much information in your head regarding what activities will give you the crests you want! It requires you to consult a spreadsheet for details! It sucks!<br><br>
				A redeeming feature of this system (this may sound elitist) is that players finally have to do harder content to get better gear which is good game design, I guess.<br><br>
				I am a little bummed that this system effectively kills the "valor farm" groups that formed last season, as those were also ways to get new players to step into mythic plus, knowing they had the safety net of geared players to help them clear dungeons.<br><br>
				Sorry for the tangent, let's talk about this garbage.

			<h2 class="title title--medium">Where do I get this new upgrade... stuff?</h2>
			<h3 class="title title--small">Shadowflame Fragments</h3>
				<p>Combine 15 fragments of a type (Whelpling, Drake, etc) to create a Shadowflame Crest of the same type.</p>
				<p>Fragments drop from endgame activities (raid, keystone dungeons, endgame world content). The harder the content, the better crests you'll get.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Raid bosses drop <span class="easy">10 fragments</span>.</li>
					<li>Timed keystone runs drop <span class="easy">12 fragments</span>.</li>
					<li>Untimed keystone runs drop <span class="hard">5 fragments</span>.</li>
					<li>Keys between 2 and 5 and LFR drops <span class="easy">Whelpling fragments</span>.</li>
					<li>Keys between 6 and 10 and Normal raid drops <span class="easy">Drake fragments</span>.</li>
					<li>Keys between 11 and 15 and Heroic raid drops <span class="med">Wyrm fragments</span>.</li>
					<li>Keys 16 and above and Mythic raid drops <span class="hard">Aspect fragments</span>.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>You can EARN 150 fragments PER TYPE PER WEEK, with the cap increasing every week (similar to the Valor cap).</p>
			<br>
			<h3 class="title title--small">Flightstones</h3>
				<p>Flightstones are the other currency you'll use to upgrade your gear. They come from pretty much any endgame activity.</p>
				<p>A <span class="easy">60% account wide discount</span> is unlocked when you get a higher item level piece of gear in a slot.</p>
			<br>
			<h3 class="title title--small">More info</h3>
				<p>Here's a couple of helpful sheets and documents that have more info than I am willing to type about this system:</p>
