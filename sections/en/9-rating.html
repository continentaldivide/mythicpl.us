			<div class="text-block">
				<p>Mythic+ rating is an indicator of a player's mythic+ experience.</p>
				<p>Your rating increases as a result of the following:
					<ul>
						<li>each time you run a dungeon you haven't completed before</li>
						<li>complete a dungeon at a higher keystone level than your previous best</li>
						<li>beat your best time in a dungeon you've already completed.</li>
					</ul>
						Completing a key provides a rating based on two factors:
					<ul>
						<li>the level of the key</li>
						<li>the amount of time it took to finish the run</li>
					</ul>
					Like Conquest and other similar systems, your Mythic+ rating will be reset at the start of a new season.</p>
					<p>In order to maximize your rating, you must complete every dungeon on both <span class="hard">Fortified</span> and <span class="hard">Tyrannical</span> weeks, as they are rated separately. Whichever of the two versions yields your higher rating for each dungeon will provide full points.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Your overall Mythic+ rating is simply the sum of your ratings for all dungeons.</p>

			<div class="text-block">
				<p><span class="med">Dragonflight Keystone Explorer: Season 3</span> unlocks when you hit 750 Mythic+ rating and has no other reward.</p>
				<p><span class="med">Dragonflight Keystone Conqueror: Season 3</span> unlocks when you hit 1500 Mythic+ rating and awards the title <span class="easy">the Smoldering</span>.</p>
				<p><span class="med">Dragonflight Keystone Master: Season 3</span> unlocks when you hit 2000 Mythic+ rating and awards the <span class="easy">Verdant Armoredon</span> mount. Note: this can also get you the achivement Dragonflight Season 3 Master (if you haven't already completed the raid on heroic or gotten to Challenger II in arena) which gives you an Emerald Mark of Mastery (a token you can trade for any piece of tier). </p>
				<p><span class="med">Dragonflight Keystone Hero: Season 3</span> unlocks when you hit 2500 Mythic+ rating and awards the <span class="easy">Emerald Blossom Dreamstone</span>, which unlocks the mythic armor appearance for your Aberrus set appearances.</p>
				<p><span class="hard">Dreaming Hero: Dragonflight Season 3</span> unlocks at the end of the season if your Mythic+ score is high enough for you to be in the top 0.1% of all players in your region (US/EU/KR, etc) and awards the title <span class="easy">"the Dreaming Hero"</span>.</p>
				<p>Additionally, timing a dungeon on +20 unlocks a portal to that dungeon in your spellbook. All dungeon portals have a shared 8 hour cooldown, but the cooldown resets when you complete any keystone.</p>
