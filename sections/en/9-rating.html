			<div class="text-block">
				<p>Mythic+ rating is an indicator of a player's mythic+ experience.</p>
				<p>Your rating increases as a result of the following:
					<ul>
						<li>each time you run a dungeon you haven't completed before</li>
						<li>complete a dungeon at a higher keystone level than your previous best</li>
						<li>beat your best time in a dungeon you've already completed.</li>
					</ul>
						Completing a key provides a rating based on two factors:
					<ul>
						<li>the level of the key</li>
						<li>the amount of time it took to finish the run</li>
					</ul>
					Like Conquest and other similar systems, your Mythic+ rating will be reset at the start of a new season.</p>
					<p>In order to maximize your rating, you must complete every dungeon on both <span class="hard">Fortified</span> and <span class="hard">Tyrannical</span> weeks, as they are rated separately. Whichever of the two versions yields your higher rating for each dungeon will provide full points.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Your overall Mythic+ rating is simply the sum of your ratings for all dungeons.</p>

				<p>Additionally, timing a dungeon on +20 unlocks a portal to that dungeon in your spellbook. The portal has a 12 hour cooldown, but resets when you time any keystone.</p>
